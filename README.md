# TwitterMiners
These are Twitter miners used for past projects in Python and R.

Whilst some of the files do very similar tasks, there are generally subtle differences.

For example, included are Python and R scripts for opening streams of tweets but some
are intended for use in a sentiment analysis pipeline whereas others are variations experimenting
with the Google Sheets API etc.
